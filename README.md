# Anno Layout Designer

- This is a hobby project to make a web app for anno layouts. (Also learning React with this project).

- Currently, I am adding the basic functionality using Anno 1800.

- Ideally, in the future, all the other Anno games will be added as well.

# Features to Add
- rotating the buildings
- clean up the `Cursor.ts` aand make separate it out so that each class handles the respective select, add or delete instead of having one handle it all
- saving your progress as JSON into base64 string (I don't know if this is a good way to do it)
- loading a saved progress via base64 string
- use localstorage for caching your current progress


# Ambitious Goals
- Add Zoom
- Add the previous anno games
- Add limitations and restrictions that would folllow naturally in the game
- Add map layer to indicate water / land / shore
