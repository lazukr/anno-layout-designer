# Anno Layout Designer

- This is a hobby project to make a web app for anno layouts.

- Currently, I am adding the basic functionality using Anno 1800.

- In the future, may consider other Anno games will be added as well.

# Redesign

- Incorporating some newer things I learnt
- Removing svg.js completely in favour of manipulating it directly as it's been somewhat weird to use with React
- Introduce Redux for state management
- Introduce Jest for testing

Since it is fully client side, you can play around with it here:
