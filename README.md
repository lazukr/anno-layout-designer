# Anno Layout Designer

- This is a hobby project to make a web app for anno layouts.

- Currently, I am adding the basic functionality using Anno 1800.

- Ideally, in the future, all the other Anno games will be added as well.

# Features to Add
- [ ] rotating the buildings
- [x] save to png
- [x] save to raw file
- [ ] cache current progress
- [ ] zoom?
- [ ] layers to denote land and water
- [ ] associate farms to the root building
- [ ] drag tiling
# Ambitious Goals
- Add the previous anno games
