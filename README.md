# Anno Layout Designer

- This is a hobby project to make a web app for anno layouts.

- Currently, I am adding the basic functionality using Anno 1800.

- In the future, may consider other Anno games will be added as well.

# Redesign

- Incorporating some newer things I learnt
  [x] Removing svg.js completely in favour of manipulating it directly as it's been somewhat weird to use with React
  [x] Remove python files
  [x] Introduce Redux for state management
  [x] Setup React Testing Library for React / Redux testing
  [ ] Add more tests for the project

Since it is fully client side, you can play around with it here:

# Features to Add

- [x] rotating the buildings (press any key)
- [x] save to png
- [x] drag tiling
- [x] drag delete
- [x] drag select
- [x] change dimensions
- [x] save and load progress as base64 json file
- [ ] cache current progress

# Ambitious Goals

- Add the previous anno games
